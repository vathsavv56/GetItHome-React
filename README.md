GetItHome â€” React rewrite

This is a minimal Vite + React scaffold that reproduces the site's UI as React components.

Quick start (PowerShell on Windows):

1. Install dependencies:

npm install

2. Run dev server:

npm run dev

3. Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

Notes:
- This is a lightweight rewrite: images use placeholders, and auth is not implemented.
- To build for production: npm run build
